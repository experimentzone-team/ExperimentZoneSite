            What does it mean to optimize a site's navigation?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The more user-friendly your site is organized, the more easily
            visitors will be able to find what they are looking for. Give them a
            clear map of the content.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Experiment Zone, we're experienced at finding the right
            categories and subcategories for your menu. The navigation is one of
            the first places we look to improve because it is essential to
            visitors finding what they are looking for - and ultimately
            converting.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-secondary">Who should optimize their navigation?</h2>
          <p>
            You should optimize your navigation if you have more than a few
            pages on your site.
          </p>
          <p>
            For e-commerce companies, you should be testing your navigation if
            you offer more than one product type.
