Attracting customers to your store is crucial in today's era of online shopping. The challenge lies in convincing those visitors to make purchases. Whether your store is a physical one or operates online, increasing product sales is vital for the profitability and long-term sustainability of your business.

The encouraging news is that there are numerous strategies you can implement to enhance the likelihood of customers making purchases from your store. This guide will discuss 15 effective methods to boost product sales and improve the overall performance of your eCommerce store.

<br/>

### **Make Your Online Store Easy to Understand with a Clear Message**

If you want to sell more on your online store, it is crucial to tell people why they should choose you. We call this your "value proposition." It's like a special message that explains why your online store is the best.

Here is the key aspect: Your value proposition needs to be short, clear, and exciting. When people visit your online store, they should quickly understand why your stuff is worth their attention and why they should pick you instead of other online stores.

Why does this matter? If your value proposition is clear and easy to understand, more people will decide to buy from you. You’ll see your bounce rates decrease, as people connect to your brand message and decide to browse your store.  They'll understand what's great about your products or services, and that helps them decide to make a purchase.

When you [create your value proposition](https://experimentzone.com/blog/3-obvious-things-your-website-is-missing-today-that-will-cause-you-to-lose-revenue-tomorrow){:target="\_blank"}, think about the differentiators for your product and company. What makes them different from others? How do they make people's lives better? What do customers describe as the reasons they buy from you? 

Answering these questions will help you make a cool message that brings in more customers and boosts your sales.

<br/>


### **Make Your Website Better for People**

[Google reports](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/10218333?hl=en){:target="\_blank"} that when they decide how to rank websites, they prioritize about how easily people can use your site to find what they need. If you run an online store, it is crucial to make sure your website gives users a great experience to boost your sales (and your Google rankings).

To make things better for your visitors, keep an eye on things like core web vitals, which provide specific, measurable ways to make your website easy to use and make sure it works well on mobile. 

Addressing the feedback from core web vitals will not only help your website rank higher on Google but also make it easier for Google to notice your site. This means more people will find your site in search results, bringing in more visitors and sales. 

Core web vitals are only a starting place for good usability. Because prospective customers have different needs and experiences with technology, you should also consider running a [usability study](https://experimentzone.com/services/usability-evaluation/){:target="\_blank"} to make sure your website design is user-friendly for your specific customers and helps them accomplish their goals of finding the right products and easily checking out.

<br/>


### **Building Trust with Social Proof**

In the eCommerce industry today, customers often turn to social proof to make decisions about what products and services to buy. Social proof is like evidence that shows how valuable your product or service is.

Social proof is important because it helps customers trust your business. It shows them that other people have used and liked what you offer. This trust is crucial for your online store because it can lead to more people buying from you.

There are different types of social proof, such as testimonials, case studies, customer reviews, awards, and endorsements from influencers. When you use social proof in your marketing, you're creating a feeling of trust and credibility around your business. This trust can help boost your sales and make more people choose your products or services.

<br/>


### **Incorporate Ways to Encourage Email and SMS Signup**

Encouraging individuals to subscribe to your email or SMS lists is a crucial aspect of how online stores communicate information about their products. It's similar to establishing connections with your customers and updating them on the latest developments, including products, sales, and more. This helps cultivate a community of interested individuals who may eventually become your customers.

There are some effective methods to increase the number of email subscribers. One approach is to offer additional benefits when they sign up, such as a discount or exclusive content. Another method is to communicate on your website that you encourage email subscriptions.

Additionally, employing pop-up forms that appear when visitors access your site can be effective. Ensuring that your website is configured for a quick and straightforward email sign-up process is also essential. Furthermore, having a well-defined privacy policy in place adds a layer of security for individuals when they decide to subscribe to emails.  [Consider A/B testing different email and SMS offers](https://experimentzone.com/services/conversion-strategy-and-testing/){:target="\_blank"} and interactions to maximize how many visitors share this information, so you can stay in touch and grow your customer base. 

<br/>


### **Enhance Your Online Shopping Experience with Easy Payment Choices**

As an eCommerce online store manager, making sure your customers enjoy a hassle-free and secure checkout is crucial. The checkout part is a huge part of how your customers feel about your store. To make sure the checkout goes smoothly, it's a wise decision to offer your customers different ways to pay. This not only speeds up the checkout but also lowers the chances of payment problems.

When we talk about "payment flexibility," we mean that customers get to pick from different payment choices when they're checking out. It could also mean letting customers split the cost of big purchases into smaller, more manageable payments. This gives shoppers the freedom to pay the way that works best for them. They can choose to pay later or make a bunch of small payments.

Flexible payment options are a great way to make your customers happy because they get to decide how they want to pay for what they buy. This not only makes it simpler for them to finish their shopping but also builds up trust and loyalty between your customers and your store. Offering different payment choices can also boost how many people buy things from your store because customers are more likely to finish their purchase when they have a bunch of payment options.

<br/>


### **Creating Reward and Referral Programs**

Reward and referral programs are becoming popular among businesses because they are a great way to thank customers for sticking around and encourage them to tell others about the business. These programs can make customers more involved, keep them coming back, and boost sales.

Reward programs give customers special treats, like discounts or free stuff, when they do certain things, purchase things, or connect with the business on social media. Referral programs let customers bring in their friends and family to the business and get rewarded for it. This can help the business get known by more people through word of mouth.

Both reward and referral programs can help a business sell more, make customers more loyal, and make the brand more famous.

<br/>


### **Address Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

Every website, particularly those of ecommerce businesses, should feature a section known as Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). This may be a standalone page or content woven within key pages of the customer journey. 
FAQs serve the purpose of addressing queries related to a product or service, guiding users on product utilization, and offering troubleshooting tips in case of issues.

Why is addressing these FAQs important? It furnishes valuable information to your customers, enhancing the likelihood of purchases from your online store. By systematically addressing common questions, you not only assist your customers but also foster trust. 

Devoting attention to responding to these questions not only aids customers in making informed decisions but also lays the groundwork for a robust and loyal customer base. When individuals trust your expertise and effortlessly find the information they seek, they are more inclined to revisit your online store for their future needs.

<br/>


### **Make Your Website Buttons Irresistible**

You know those buttons on a website that tell you what to do? Those are called call-to-actions (CTAs), and they're critical for any business that wants more people to buy things on their website. 

CTAs are buttons that tell visitors to do things like sign up for newsletters, download offers, or buy something. However, there's a key aspect: the buttons need to be designed in a way that makes people want to click them and become customers. The button must pass the “squint test” - these buttons should stand out more than anything else on the screen, especially if you sit back from your screen and “squint” at your screen.

To make your website buttons the best they can be, you can start with some basic research to understand which actions matter - and which are being missed. First, check out what people do on your website through web analytics and click tracking. Try different button designs [via A/B testing](https://experimentzone.com/services/conversion-strategy-and-testing/){:target="\_blank"} to see which one works the best. Keep changing the words and looks of your buttons to make them super effective. By doing these things, you'll make sure that your online store's buttons are supercharged for success.

<br/>


### **Get More Customers with Free Shipping**

Consider this, people love getting stuff delivered to their door for free.! Offering free shipping is a great way to make customers happy and get them to buy more from your online store. It can be considered a special benefit for them. Most people [(in America) expect free shipping when they buy things online according to JungleScout](https://www.junglescout.com/press/press-releases/66-of-american-consumers-expect-free-shipping-on-all-online-orders/){:target="\_blank"}.

When you offer free shipping, tell your customers how much they need to spend to get it. This way, they'll be motivated to increase their cart value to unlock free delivery. Make sure to message how close they are to the free shipping offer (and when they unlock free shipping). 

<br/>


### **Speed Up Your Website for a Happier Experience**

Imagine waiting and waiting for a website to load – not fun, right? That's why making your website load fast is critical. If it takes too long, people will leave and not come back. Here's the deal: your website and its pages should load in about 5 seconds or less. [Recent research shows that if it takes more than 3 seconds](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/#:~:text=New%20research%20by%20Google%20has,seconds%20on%20a%204G%20connection.){:target="\_blank"}, some people might give up and leave. Let's keep them happy and interested.

Making your website faster is like giving your visitors a great experience. It also helps your website show up higher when people search for things on the internet. You should use Google’s PageSpeed analyzer, which will give you specific ways to speed things up - such as making pictures the right size and reducing the code to give your website a turbo boost and grow conversions.

<br/>


### **Boost Your Sales with Upselling and Cross-selling**

Ever heard of upselling? It's like suggesting to your customers, "Hey, why not go for the deluxe version?" It's 20 times more effective than cross-selling, which is when you say, "Since you're buying this, why not get that too?"

Here's the deal: these techniques can make each customer spend a bit more, adding up to bigger profits over time. But, and here's the important part, don't overwhelm your customers. Think of it as friendly advice, not pushy sales talk. Provide quick options to upsell and cross-sell - and a way to keep the current project as-is if they’re ready to go. Make sure to A/B test any of the options you’re adding that could help or hurt the customer journey and ultimately your revenue. 

<br/>


### **Create Targeted Content for Key Market Segments**

Want more people to check out your online shop? Tailor your content to the folks you're trying to reach. If you create content that talks directly to your audience, it's easier for them to understand and connect with your offer - and shortcuts their decision-making process to purchase.

How? Do some detective work. Figure out what your target customers like and don't like. You should consider conducting surveys or interviews. 

Once you know your customers, you can create content that matches their way of thinking and the language they use to describe their problems - and your solution. 

You can also use personalization by leveraging information from previous purchases to design content and experiences that help customers find product recommendations based on their past experiences with your brand. This way, you're more likely to turn visitors into happy customers.

Remember, understanding your customers is the key to unlocking success in your chosen markets.

<br/>


### **Introducing Chatbots for Easy Help**

Introducing live chats with chatbots as backup can significantly help visitors navigate your product offering and ultimately drive more conversions when done right Chatbots can answer questions, give info, and even guide customers through buying stuff; they can also be the frontline ahead of your live customer support, so your team can focus on more complex customer needs.

<br/>


### **Use Videos to Boost Your Sales**

In today’s ecommerce, carefully created videos are a powerful way to connect with customers and sell products. They can simplify complex ideas, showcase product features, share customer stories, and demonstrate how to use a product or service. Adding videos to your website can increase sales and make customers happier.

Placing videos on your main sales pages grabs visitors' attention, offers an interactive experience, and delivers valuable information quickly. Make sure to test the video placement via A/B testing to balance the valuable information in the video with its potential disruption to the flow of the customer journey.  

Videos also help your website show up higher in online searches by keeping visitors engaged and spending more time on your site. Plus, people are more likely to share videos on social media, which boosts your brand's visibility.

By using videos on your key sales pages, you can significantly improve your return on investment (ROI). With careful planning, you can make the most of this powerful marketing tool to increase your overall sales.

<br/>


### **Try A/B Testing for Better Online Sales**
