## Understanding Conversion Rate Optimization

Do you have a website or a landing page where you want people to convert (such as purchasing a product or filling out a form)? If you want to get more from the marketing spend you’re doing to get visitors to the page, you need to improve your conversion rates and get a larger percentage of visitors to convert. That's where [Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)](https://experimentzone.com/conversion-rate-optimization/) comes in. CRO is like a strategy to understand how to encourage the people who visit your website to do the thing you want them to do. It's an important strategy for businesses because it helps them drive more revenue from their customers and improves the ROI from their digital marketing spend.

To get started with CRO, you need to understand how people use your website (to identify friction points in the customer journey) and [conduct tests (A/B testing)](https://experimentzone.com/blog/start-AB-testing-ideas) to make targeted improvements (backed by real-world data). This helps you figure out what might be stopping people from working with your company and taking key actions to become your customers.

When your CRO strategy works, it improves conversions and the experience of your customers. People feel comfortable and enjoy being your customer. CRO also builds trust and reputation for your brand by introducing value propositions and social proof in ways that are memorable and impact the decision to become a customer.

CRO is also about using numbers and facts to make decisions. You keep testing different elements on your site such as headlines, content, call-to-action (CTA) buttons, or entire customer journey flows. You see what people understand and can use easiest and use those results to drive conversions.

Today’s blog post features effective, free marketing tools on the internet to help you get started with CRO. Whether you're a pro or just starting, this guide will show you the best free tools to make your website convert at higher rates.
