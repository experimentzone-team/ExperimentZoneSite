We'll take you through three examples of things that should be on every homepage. So let's start with the first one. AJ, what's the first thing that every home page should have?
<br/><br/>

#### AJ Davis  0:08  
Every homepage needs to **have a clear call to action**, so it can focus visitor attention. And ideally, this would be above the fold.
<br/><br/>

#### Podcaster  0:17  
All right, and what's the second component?
<br/><br/>

#### AJ Davis  0:21  
The second thing is the site needs to **be very clear about the service or the product that you offer**. A lot of the time people are fancy or abstract with the language they're using. But we see in testing that being very direct and using very short sentences can be very effective in communicating.
<br/><br/>

#### Podcaster  0:37  
All right, and the third one?
<br/><br/>

#### AJ Davis  0:40  
You have to answer the question, "Why you? Why this business? What makes you special?" You need to **talk about what differentiates you from your competitors**. What are those key value propositions and differentiators?
<br/><br/>

#### Podcaster  0:51  
Okay, so those are the three components every homepage should have, every website should have on their homepage.
