### Transcript

##### Podcaster  0:00
What benefits can businesses get in a month with a conversion rate optimization company?
<br/><br/>

##### AJ Davis  0:07  
Well, business goals are to uncover and solve customer complaints and to increase conversion rates. That's why they engage with a CRO agency and there are a couple of methods that require a month or less to get quick wins. Those two are the user experience (UX) site audit and the analytics analysis.
<br/><br/>

##### odcaster  0:24  
Okay, how are these going to help the companies that use them?
<br/><br/>

##### AJ Davis  0:25  
With analytics, we can understand where we are losing customers, and where they are getting lost along the funnel. We can also understand more about the audience. With the audit, we can understand customer pain points, we can find quick fixes, and create prioritization about how to tackle those. The last thing is to identify what should be on our roadmap, both for testing and for improvements down the road.
<br/><br/>

##### Podcaster  0:54  
Okay! Can you talk real quickly about how long each of those takes?
<br/><br/>

##### AJ Davis  0:58  
At Experiment Zone, each of these takes about three weeks, so you can do both of them as a conversion deep dive. End-to-end, in 3-4 weeks you'll have all of these deliverables.
