### Transcript

Welcome to today's episode of Testing the Experience. This video is for those of you who are spending time and money to get traffic to your site, but you're just not seeing the conversion rates come out of it. So I'm here with AJ, the founder, and CEO of Experiment Zone. She is going to share some test ideas with us. But first, AJ, before we launch that, can you tell us why we test?
<br/><br/>

##### AJ Davis  0:24  
We test because customers aren't always predictable. Testing tells us what people are doing, their behaviors, and what they respond to.  What we see is that both big and small things we think will have an impact can really have a major impact on conversion, and ultimately, customer behavior.  So we have examples of tests that have small incremental lifts to test that we didn't expect to have an increase that massively grows conversion rates.
<br/><br/>

##### AJ Davis  0:59  
Today, we're gonna be taking a look at how businesses are marketing and talking about their services.
<br/><br/>

##### Podcaster  1:06  
Okay, and then what is the first thing that these customers and these sites should be thinking about, like the first test ideas?
<br/><br/>

##### AJ Davis  1:16  
Now a lot of people are going to wonder, does this work? There are a lot of products out there and services that don't work, and they're going to be looking for social proof information about the efficacy or the effectiveness of the product and service itself. So we're going to take a look first at weightwatchers.com. Take a look at their homepage as that first impression, they're emphasizing here, that you get to try it out, really prove that it's working or not before you, and commit to a longer-term relationship with them. And then they also use imagery and very simple data points here on the right side to highlight, this is the loss that real people have had from using this. They also have a nice call to action here of "take a personal assessment," before joining now, so you can get more information about whether it will work for you.
<br/><br/>

##### Podcaster  2:03  
Alright, great. And then let's get another one.
<br/><br/>

##### AJ Davis  2:08  
Now, with Noom, their homepage is simple. They have one call to action, but it's not a very actionable action, it just has the word "Continue." That doesn't mean a lot to me as a customer, and I can learn how to eat more mindfully with them. But I'm not sure what that means or how effective it is, so I might be tempted to click on continue because there's nothing else to do here. If we do that, I'm hoping that we'll start seeing some social proof. Okay, now I'm in a kind of personal assessment data collection. It's straightforward. And you'll probably see a lot of people clicking on that button because there are not a lot of other options. But they would benefit from doing more A/B testing on that homepage to talk about outcomes. What are you going to get from this? Why are you going to do this? What have the outcomes been for other people?
<br/><br/>

##### Podcaster  2:58  
Okay, got it. So the first one is efficacy. What's another thing that the site should think about as they talk to their customers and do for the customers?
<br/><br/>

##### AJ Davis  3:06  
I think a lot of the time people want to get into the details about what's included. How does this work? How is it different from other plans? If we go to Jennycraig.com, they've got this page to shop for different plans. They're reinforcing that last messaging at the top, and you do have to work to scroll down and see the plan details, but it is above the fold, so that's a good start. They simply lay it out on a table. You can quickly see the price, and they talk about sort of simple, essential, and rapid results. So you get a sense that moving from the left to the right side, you get a bigger impact or more things from it. And then visually, they're using a bulleted list to highlight the different things that you're going to get from it. 

It also appears that you're getting more as you move across the table. These are pretty good ways to simplify how you're presenting what's included, and what's not included. They also have these icons down below that illustrate maybe a broader value proposition of what you get. You get food or you get things that involve a person like a coach. They do have some calls to action here. But as you can see on the screen, they are below the fold as you're looking through those other items. So if I were Jenny Craig, I would be looking at ways to increase the visibility of the order now, as you're reviewing and scanning this list.
<br/><br/>

##### Podcaster  4:29  
Right, let's compare it to another plan’s page.
<br/><br/>

##### AJ Davis  4:36  
Weight Watchers, they're still enforcing that first message about "free free free," which we find is very effective and testing and I suspect they're leaning into that pretty heavily here. As you start going down here, there's one for everyone, this is much more platform-centric. So you know digitally, they're using that phone to convey it but you have to stop and read through all this text to understand what the differences are on a more granular level. I think they have an opportunity here to bring in other visual elements or to have a list that builds and shows. 

Okay, I'm getting more, and from left to right, these are adding more features, versus what they're doing now they're just saying plus digital. That does require someone to notice that and then go back and read things on the left, such as creating more friction as you go. So I think some simpler text here, as well as reiterating what's included for each of these categories would be some opportunities for improvement.
<br/><br/>

##### Podcaster  5:37  
Okay, so we went over the plans. And let's go over one other big idea. What's another thing that these sites should think about?
<br/><br/>

##### AJ Davis  5:44  
What happens if I need to bail? What are my opt-out options? What happens if I don't like this? Or if it's not working for me? If we go to Nutrisystem.com, we can take a look here to kind of understand what's going to happen if I don't want to do this. You go through getting your plan, setting up the details, who you are, what the delivery is that it's auto-delivered, money back guarantee, and next to the continue button. They have the same issue where they're using “Continue.” So it's less action-oriented, it's less. I think there's an opportunity for them to do some copy testing here to speak to like, what's going to happen next on the next page. But back to the, can I opt out? What if I don't like it, having these value propositions that you get your money back, it's guaranteed that you're going to lose weight fast? Having these next two key decision points or CTAs, we've seen that to be effective when we do testing.
<br/><br/>

##### Podcaster  6:43  
Right? Okay. So those are three big ideas on these sites to think about, or any site that is offering a weight loss or diet program. But there are so many more things that these sites can do. Right? AJ
<br/><br/>

##### AJ Davis  6:57  
I think one of the things brands need to think about is how to get more revenue from their site to know that they're moving in the right direction. The goal is to build an experimentation mindset and test anything that could impact conversion. And in our years doing this, we've seen both big and small things can impact conversion and testing is the only way that we know which way we've moved the needle. So what we do is we help customers make experimentation, the driving force for their companies, so that our customers are getting 10x or greater ROI from working with us and are moving confidently in the direction that their customers need.
<br/><br/>

##### Podcaster  7:36  
Yeah, it's always beneficial to help our customers get that huge lift in ROI. Well, thank you, AJ.
