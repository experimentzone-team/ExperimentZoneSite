A central element of digital marketing is [conversion rate optimization](/conversion-rate-optimization) (CRO). CRO is the practice of improving customer experiences and journeys, so that visitors are more likely to complete a desired action (“convert”). Depending on what goal a company is focused on, the conversion could be completing a form, downloading a white paper, or making a purchase.

Have you been curious about CRO strategy, but not sure where to start? We’ve prepared a set of key books for getting started in the field of conversion rate optimization. No matter how experienced you are in marketing, it is essential to incorporate ongoing learning (and even rereading the basics with a more practical outlook). The field of CRO is ever changing and multifaceted, so many teams find it challenging to get a new program started.

These books can provide a good place to begin, especially when paired with experienced CRO experts like our team at Experiment Zone.

</div>

One of the first books you should pick up in this space is the Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug book.  It's a common sense approach to web usability, and it is a quick and easy read. This is a great book to start with if you've never really thought about usability and how to design a website. The examples are a little bit outdated in the first edition ([check revised version here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18197267-don-t-make-me-think-revisited){:target="\_blank"}). We believe this book clearly conveys the concepts around  don't make your customers think: tell them what you do and make it obvious.

The Lean Startup is a really influential book for our team at Experiment Zone. Eric Ries drives philosophy to approaching a problem not with “I know the answer” but with “I know how to ask the question”.  Once you have the question, you know what to do to find the answer. This philosophy makes a huge difference in the ability to think iteratively, get really curious, and experiment with everything you’re doing.

The conversion optimization process is an art and science. It consists of a series of steps that are repeated until the desired result is achieved.

The first step in the conversion optimization process is identifying the goals for your website. These goals should be measurable, so that you know when you have achieved them. The next step is to create a hypothesis, which is a guess about what will happen if you make changes to your website. You then run tests by implementing changes and measuring the results against your hypothesis to see if they work or not.

In this book, you will learn how to use conversion optimization techniques such as A/B testing, multivariate testing, and segmentation in your marketing campaigns. It will also show you how to create persuasive content that converts visitors into leads and leads into customers.
