Hi AJ! Marketing teams have a lot of competing priorities, so tell me why they should invest time and money into CRO.
<br/><br/>

##### AJ Davis  0:09  
A lot of marketing strategies whether that's SEO, Pay Per Click (PPC), email, etc. They are focused on getting visitors familiar with your site and then ultimately getting them to visit your site. CRO or conversion rate optimization is the practice of getting customers who are already on your site to cross that finish line getting them to convert in order. And so we are just a different piece of the puzzle.
<br/><br/>

##### Podcaster  0:35  
All right! Then, who does this apply to? Who should be using this?
<br/><br/>

##### AJ Davis  0:41  
If you have a website, you have got to be thinking about CRO, whether you are doing CRO and conversion rate optimization with a perspective of trying to get more orders, trying to get more leads from your site, or getting more signups for your SaaS product. All of these different verticals and objectives can benefit from using CRO.
<br/><br/>

##### Podcaster  1:03  
Okay! Last question! What portion of a team's marketing budget should be spent on CRO?
<br/><br/>

##### AJ Davis  1:11  
This depends on where the business is in its lifecycle. If they are getting the traffic they want, but it's not converting, they should be focusing more on CRO. And if they don't understand who their potential customers are, why they are leaving, and some of those pain points, that's another reason to increase it as a portion of your marketing spend. But these two pieces of the puzzle go hand in hand, so it depends on the business. And we are always happy to chat about the right mix for your company.
