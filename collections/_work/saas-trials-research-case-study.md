## Client Background

A software-as-a-service (Saas) company aims to market to prospective customers with a video demo and an offer of a free trial of their software. The company wanted to increase the efficacy of their marketing efforts, generating more leads with the same spend.

<br>

## The Challenge

Visitors were reaching the landing pages and engaging with the content, but the portion of visitors signing up for a free trial were low. These product pages included detailed information about the software, but did not highlight “why” the customer should get this solution from this company. Visitors could find this information on the homepage, but many would not include a homepage view during their visit to the website. The company wanted to guide visitors to the right content, and ultimately see a larger percentage of those prospects convert to a free trial.

<br>

## Our Strategy

We initially recommended bringing the value position information from the homepage and repeating the same information on the product page. After running the test, we found that this did not impact whether visitors converted or not on the page.

Rather than move on, our team dug into this inconclusive experiment. We ran usability studies with representative customers to learn how they understood and responded to the value propositions, so we could iterate on the test and find a winning solution.

<br>

## The Results

We overwhelmingly found that participants in the user study saw the value proposition - and understood it - but they generally thought “so what?” Visitors said that this didn’t help differentiate the SaaS company from other options on the market. We took these insights and collaborated with the client to truly identify the reasons customers should buy from them. We retested with the new value propositions and saw a significant **increase in the portion of visitors signing up for a free trial through the landing pages**.
