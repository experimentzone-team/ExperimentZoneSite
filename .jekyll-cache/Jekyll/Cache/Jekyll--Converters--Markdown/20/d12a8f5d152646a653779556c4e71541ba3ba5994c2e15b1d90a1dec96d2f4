<p>An insurance company had a talented and robust sales team fielding leads through the website. They initially invested heavily in search engine optimization (SEO) and paid ads but werenâ€™t getting the conversion rates they needed to continue investing in these efforts.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>

<p>The company specializes in specific industries and wanted leads to fill out a form on the site to help categorize the prospect. The company struggled to entice visitors to fill out the form, giving the sales team a minimal lead profile for their initial calls. The company also encouraged visitors to directly access representatives in their industry through dedicated landing pages per industry. Still, most visitors didnâ€™t interact with these pages and utilized the main page, creating more manual work for the sales team.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="our-strategy">Our Strategy</h2>

<p>Our team needed to collect data to understand how visitors interacted with the form. We initially added tracking to each field of the form to understand how visitors started - and when they stopped - filling out the form. This would help us understand where the biggest points of friction were in the experience.</p>

<p>Additionally, we needed to make sure that prospective customers saw the form. The display of the form varied between different pages. On some pages, the form was highly visible at the top of the page. Other pages did not present the call to action to get a quote until the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>Based on the click tracking and user experience audit, we built an A/B test roadmap that focused on friction points around form visibility and form content. The test ideas were scored based on the visibility, level of effort, the likelihood of success, and our expected level of impact, in order to ensure the most effective testing program.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>

<p>During our initial 6 month engagement, we ran 6 tests. Three of these tests increased the companyâ€™s leads and were recommended for permanent implementation.</p>

<p>The tests ran across the entire funnel. Visitors early in the funnel were more likely to engage with the first field of the form. Farther down the funnel, more visitors completed the full form and became leads. Overall, we saw a <strong>26% increase in qualified leads through the website</strong>.</p>
